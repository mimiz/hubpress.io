Recently I had to publish multiple application on a single machine and all applications will be publicly available on their own domains names.

As I am a docker addict, I want all my applications to be running as a docker container.

Imagine I have the following applications : 

|===
| name
| url
| Container Name
| Container Port (Expose)

| app1
| www.app1.lol
| app1-container
| 3000

| app2
| www.app2.lol
| app2-container
| 4000

| app3
| www.app3.lol
| app3-container
| 8080
|===
* app1 : www.app1.lol : container nam : 
* app2 : www.app2.lol
* app3 : www.app3.lol

The thing is that I do not want to install a proxy (Apache or Nginx) on the docker host, so I wanted to create a docker container that will act as a proxy of all my applications
