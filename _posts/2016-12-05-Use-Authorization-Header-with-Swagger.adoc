= Use Authorization Header with Swagger
:hp-tags: Swagger, Authorization, Bearer, API, Express, JWT

Recently, on a project I had to document an API using http://swagger.io/[Swagger], as an authentication mechanism, the API, is using JWT.

The Token needs to be set in the `Authorization` Header of the HTTP request as this : 

[source]
----
Authorization Bearer: JWT-token
----

As we wanted to use the http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI] to allow clients to test requests and responses of the API.

To define the API, we use  the http://swagger.io/swagger-editor/[Swagger Editor] Online.

== Start the Documentation and the /login route

First we need to create the main API description : 

[source, yaml]
----
swagger: '2.0'
info:
 version: 0.0.1
 title: MY-SUPERB-API
host: '127.0.0.1:4000'
schemes:
 - http
 - https
produces:
 - application/json
paths:
 /login:
  post:
   tags:
    - auth
   description: |
    Allow users to log in, and to receive a Token
   parameters:
    - 
     in: body
     name: body
     description: The email/password
     required: true
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Login'
   responses:
    '200':
     description: Login Success
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Token'
    '400':
     description: Whether the user is not found or error while login
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
    '403':
     description: >-
      If user is not found (bad credentials) OR if user can not login (a
      concierge of an unsctive client)
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
definitions:
 Login:
  type: object
  properties:
   email:
    type: string
   password:
    type: string
 Token:
  type: object
  properties:
   token:
    type: string
 Error:
  type: object
  properties:
   message:
    type: string
   error:
    type: string
----

This will define the `/login` route that receive a `POST` HTTP request with email and password, if they matches your credential provider the route will return a `Token` response : 

[source, json]
----
{
  "token":"JWT TOKEN"
}
----

== Describe the Security Definition

Now we should define create a *securityDefinitions*, this will describe how authorization is made, and allow the http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI] to ask for a token when needed.

So first edit the API definition : 
[source, yaml]
----
swagger: '2.0'
info:
 version: 0.0.1
 title: MY-SUPERB-API
host: '127.0.0.1:4000'
schemes:
 - http
 - https
produces:
 - application/json
securityDefinitions: <1>
 Bearer:
  description: |
   For accessing the API a valid JWT token must be passed in all the queries in
   the 'Authorization' header.


   A valid JWT token is generated by the API and retourned as answer of a call
   to the route /login giving a valid user & password.


   The following syntax must be used in the 'Authorization' header :

       Bearer: xxxxxx.yyyyyyy.zzzzzz
  type: apiKey
  name: Authorization
  in: header
paths:
 /login:
  post:
   tags:
    - auth
   description: |
    Allow users to log in, and to receive a Token
   parameters:
    - 
     in: body
     name: body
     description: The email/password
     required: true
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Login'
   responses:
    '200':
     description: Login Success
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Token'
    '400':
     description: Whether the user is not found or error while login
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
    '403':
     description: >-
      If user is not found (bad credentials) OR if user can not login (a
      concierge of an unsctive client)
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
definitions:
 Login:
  type: object
  properties:
   email:
    type: string
   password:
    type: string
 Token:
  type: object
  properties:
   token:
    type: string
 Error:
  type: object
  properties:
   message:
    type: string
   error:
    type: string
----
<1> Ajout de la clÃ© *securityDefinitions* 

The description is, I think, self described, so you can understand it

== Create a protected route

And now you can define a route `/users` for example that needs the user to send a valid Authorization header  ...

[source, yaml]
----
swagger: '2.0'
info:
 version: 0.0.1
 title: MY-SUPERB-API
host: '127.0.0.1:4000'
schemes:
 - http
 - https
produces:
 - application/json
securityDefinitions:
 Bearer:
  description: |
   For accessing the API a valid JWT token must be passed in all the queries in
   the 'Authorization' header.


   A valid JWT token is generated by the API and retourned as answer of a call
   to the route /login giving a valid user & password.


   The following syntax must be used in the 'Authorization' header :

       Bearer: xxxxxx.yyyyyyy.zzzzzz
  type: apiKey
  name: Authorization
  in: header
paths:
 /login:
  post:
   tags:
    - auth
   description: |
    Allow users to log in, and to receive a Token
   parameters:
    - 
     in: body
     name: body
     description: The email/password
     required: true
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Login'
   responses:
    '200':
     description: Login Success
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Token'
    '400':
     description: Whether the user is not found or error while login
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
    '403':
     description: >-
      If user is not found (bad credentials) OR if user can not login (a
      concierge of an unsctive client)
     schema:
      $ref: '#/definitions/Error'
 /users:
  get:
   tags:
    - users
   security:
    - Bearer: []
   description: Get a list of all existing users
   responses:
    '200':
     description: An array of users
     schema:
      type: array
      items:
       $ref: '#/definitions/User'
definitions:
 Login:
  type: object
  properties:
   email:
    type: string
   password:
    type: string
 Token:
  type: object
  properties:
   token:
    type: string
 Error:
  type: object
  properties:
   message:
    type: string
   error:
    type: string
 User:
    type: object
    properties:
     email:
      type: string
     password:
      type: string
     firstName:
      type: string
     lastName:
      type: string
     lastLogin:
      type: string
      format: date
----

Now you just described that the `/users` route need the Bearer authentication ...

== Use Swagger UI

In order to use the Swagger UI, you should be aware that the *host* value is defined on _'127.0.0.1:4000'_ and this may be changed in your case ! 

=== First Login and get the token

The now you can use the http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI] (with the editor) to login : 

image::swagger-auth-1.png[]

And the response should be : 

image::swagger-auth-2.png[]

=== Authenticate the editor :

Now at the top of the generated documentation you can click the *Authenticate* Button : 

image::swagger-auth-3.png[]

Then fill with the Token you received at the previous step : 

image::swagger-auth-4.png[]

NOTE: We are spcifying the *Bearer:* keyword.

=== Try the protected route

Now in the section of the protected route : `/users` you can check the _Bearer_ checkbox and try the operation : 

image::swagger-auth-5.png[]

You should have a valid answer : 

image::swagger-auth-6.png[]

Now you can add your other routes to finish defined your API.

Have fun !
